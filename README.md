![Alt text](https://github.com/minhazkamal/Ayomoy-Life-Saver/blob/main/src/sample/images/donorPanel.png)

## Donor Information
The Donor can set the *Paying Status* to *paid or NON-Paid* depending on the need. For *Eligibility*, the Donor can upload a test report here and later the *Admin* will review it. And For an *Eligable Donor*, s/he might be reluctant to donate blood for any personal issues. So the *Activ Staus* can be set to *Inactive* and the system will not this particular person in any search resul for blood donor.<br/><br/>

The lower portion is showing the previous review of reports that was done by *Admin*.<br/><br/>

## Donation Information
This is like a *clipboard* for the donor to store his donation innformaition. Filters are there to impose on the showed list.<br/><br/>

![Alt text](https://github.com/minhazkamal/Ayomoy-Life-Saver/blob/main/src/sample/images/seependingrequest.png)

Also the *apply filer* button can extract other types of requests in case the user is interested.<br/><br/>


## Donee Panel
Here are three buttons for the Donee to make use of. 
![Alt text](https://github.com/minhazkamal/Ayomoy-Life-Saver/blob/main/src/sample/images/doneePanel.png)

First of all the Donee can search for *Donor* or *Organization* which is fairly simple. Also, there is an option submit a donation request beforehand.  
![Alt text](https://github.com/minhazkamal/Ayomoy-Life-Saver/blob/main/src/sample/images/newRequofDonee.png)

Submitting a new reqeust will enqueue it to the system and then it will automatically redirect to the *Previous Request* page which is just the list of all the requests that are in the system queued to be responded. 

## Organization Dashboard 
Here the *Update Profile* and *Use as Donee* buttons provide the same funcutionality as stated earlier in the person section. 
![Alt text](https://github.com/minhazkamal/Ayomoy-Life-Saver/blob/main/src/sample/images/orgDashboard.png)

The *Use as Organizaton* button gives us the Organization Panel.
![Alt text](https://github.com/minhazkamal/Ayomoy-Life-Saver/blob/main/src/sample/images/orgPanel.png)

Here *See Pending Request* is same as seen before on the *Person* section. The *Organization Information* is there for the updating of the Licencse periodically so that later the *Admin* can review them and asses their validity. 
![Alt text](https://github.com/minhazkamal/Ayomoy-Life-Saver/blob/main/src/sample/images/orgInfo.png)

## Admin
This is a *hardcoded super profile* for the system administration and the main task of the profile is to update the eligbilty of the *Person* and the *Organazitaiton*. The *Admin Panel* has three buttons. *Change Password* is same as before. 
![Alt text](https://github.com/minhazkamal/Ayomoy-Life-Saver/blob/main/src/sample/images/adminPanel.png)

Then comes the *Donor's List* where the *admin* will be able to review the test reports and give him/ her eligibilty flags. Also there is a *comment* section where *admin* can pass on some important remarks if necessary. The *view* button shows the test report that was updated by the *Person* earlier. 
![Alt text](https://github.com/minhazkamal/Ayomoy-Life-Saver/blob/main/src/sample/images/donorslistAdmin.png)

Same mechanism is there for the *Organizations List* where the *admin* looks into the Licence of the *Organization* and gives the eligibilty flags.
